There is a flower within my heart
Daisy, Daisy
Planted one day by a glancing Dad
Planted by daisy bell
Whether she loves me or loves me not
Sometimes it's hard to tell
Yet I am longing to share the lot
A beautiful daisy bell

Daisy, Daisy give me your heart to do
I'm half crazy, hopeful in love with you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford the carriage
But you look sweet upon the street
On a bicycle built for two

We will go tandem as man and wife
Daisy, Daisy
Peddling our way down the road of life
I and my daisy bell
When the roads and we both despise
Please men the lambs as well
There are bright lights in those dazzling ice
A beautiful daisy bell

Daisy, Daisy give me your heart to do
I'm half crazy, hopeful in love with you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford the carriage
But you look sweet upon the street
On a bicycle built for two

I'll stand by you in wear or well Daisy, Daisy
You'll be the bell we'll try to rip you know
Sweet little daisy bell, You'll take the lead in each trip we take
And if I dropped out, I will say here's the drink by beautiful daisy bell

Daisy, Daisy give me your heart to do
I'm half crazy, hopeful in love with you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford the carriage
But you look sweet upon the street
On a bicycle built for two

Daisy, Daisy give me your heart to do
I'm half crazy, hopeful in love with you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford the carriage
But you look sweet upon the street
On a bicycle built for two

But you look sweet upon the street
On a bicycle built for two
On a bicycle built for two
On a bicycle built for two
For two, for two, for two, for two


Goodbye Dave!
